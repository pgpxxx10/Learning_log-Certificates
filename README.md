I'm a passionate expert in planning, forecasting and procurement with more than 20 years of experience in the Supply Chain. 
For most of my carrier, I worked for a large organization that collects lots of data.
Collecting, accessing and processing the correct information becomes more and more challenging in the corporate world. On one hand, we have better tools and more information to analyze. On the second hand, we have lots of unnecessary information and noise. Work as a specialist in any business becomes more complex and requires a new skill set.

In September 2020 I decided to master my skills in the Data field and become Data Scientist. I started my path by learning from online sources like Cognitive_class, DataCamp, Github, Kaggle. 
I will add here my all certifications collected during learning to become a Data Scientist.
I started with Python as my main programing language.
I will add SQL to my skillset as an important component for accessing and processing data.
My goal is to be an expert in the machine learning world.
